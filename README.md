# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm VinÃ­cius Crepschi
I'm currently a Mobile Software Engineer working with React Native. I graduated in Computer Science at UFSCar in 2021 and I've been working with tech since 2020. I strive to learn new things everyday and share what I know with my peers. 

On my free time I play card games like Yugioh and Magic: The Gathering, listen to a lot of music and play video games.
